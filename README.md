## How to use

In the auto-eq directory, navigate to the **scripts** folder and just double click on the the script you wish to run. 

If you want to see what each script executes, right click on the script and open it in a text editor like Notepad. **NOTE: You will need to modify the character names in the scripts for some of these to perform correctly**

`Shift + Ctrl + 1` - Auto assist the target defined in the script

### Shaman
